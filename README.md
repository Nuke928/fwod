## Four Walls of Death - A silly C# Console-based game

![fwod on Windows](http://www.wilomgfx.net/didier/pages/fwod/img1.png)

Hello! This is a little something I'd like to show you, it's simply a console-based game using the .NET framework, being Mono compatible.

fwod would play like NetHack, a roguelike, turn-based game (well it's instant), dungeon crawling game.

Reason I'm doing this is to expand my knownledge about C# even further and learn more profoundly about game development.

There isn't going to be much though, since my programming skills are not very advanced.

You can always send me an [email](mailto:devddstuff@gmail.com) or open a ticket for any issues, questions, or suggestions.
(I won't bite!)
