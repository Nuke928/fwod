## Four Walls of Death

Hello! This is a little something I'd like to show you, it's simply a console-based game using the Mono runtime.

Yes, it is like the original Rogue and NetHack, but I doubt I'd even implement that much.

Here is what I use:
- Xamarin Studio 5.9.4
- Mono 4.5

The project is Visual Studio compatible (.NET 4.5)

You can always send me an [email](devddstuff@gmail.com).

### TODO
- Make a dedicated buffer (to remember character positions and stuff)
- Make player and enemy mechanics
- Colors~!
- Multiline chat bubbles

### Issues
- MonoDevelop (Linux) can't seem to open the CS files.
