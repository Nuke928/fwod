## Four Walls of Death - Silly C# Console-based game

Hello! This is a little something I'd like to show you, it's simply a console-based game using the .NET framework, being Mono compatible.

Yes, it is kind of like the original Rogue and NetHack.
(Also because Rogue started in 1980 (!!!))

There isn't going to be much though, since my programming skills are not very advanced.

Here is what I use:
- Visual Studio 2012 (Update 4)
- Windows 8.1 Pro

You can always send me an [email](mailto:devddstuff@gmail.com).
(I won't bite!)

### Notes
- Code reorganization/restructures/cleanups are made from time to time

### Builds
Some builds will be available on my [website](http://www.wilomgfx.net/didier/pages/fwod.html) (Sometime soon when I feel it's good enough).

### TODO
- Every TODO are indicated with "//TODO:"
- Every ideas are indicated with "//IDEA:"

Most of them are written in Program.cs (ideas too).

### Issues (Code specific unrelated)
- MonoDevelop can't seem to open the source files.
- I lack of a story (People love them!).

If you have any issues, questions, or suggestions, please open an issue ticket, or email me.

Here are some tips for issueing a good ticket:
- Recommendations are always better than orders
- You don't need to ask me "Why?" at everything I do
- Keep it polite and neutral

You can ask "Why did you [...]" but remember to keep it neutral.

### License
This project uses the MIT license, which you can read from the LICENSE file.
