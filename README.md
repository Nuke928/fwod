# fwod
## Four Walls of Death - A silly roguelike

![fwod on Windows](http://www.wilomgfx.net/didier/pages/fwod/img1.png)

Hello! This is a little something I'd like to show you, it's simply a console application game using the .NET framework, while being Mono compatible.

fwod would play like NetHack, a roguelike, turn-based game (well it's instant), dungeon crawling game.

Reason I'm doing this is to expand my knowledge about C# even further and learn more profoundly about game development. (In a way. Next might be with Unity)

You can always send me an [email](mailto:devddstuff@gmail.com) or open a ticket. (I won't bite!)

### Notes
- Code reorganization/restructures/cleanups are made from time to time
- The game will change dramatically often during development process
- Fixed 80x25 resolution for increased compatiblity
  - Windows 10 buffer screen size is bigger by default, and I can't shrink it
- Colors are planned

### Progress
Very likely in order
- Proposal: Basic idea implemented, in code
- Implemented: Implementation of the idea
- Testing: Fully Testing
- Functional: Finished and ready to use fully

### Issues (Code specific unrelated)
- MonoDevelop can't open the source files
  - Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio can.
