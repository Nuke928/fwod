## Four Walls of Death - Silly C# Console-based game

Hello! This is a little something I'd like to show you, it's simply a console-based game using the Mono runtime.

Yes, it is kind of like the original Rogue and NetHack.
(Also because Rogue started in 1980 (!!!))

There isn't going to be much though, since my programming skills are not that great.

Here is what I use:
- Xamarin Studio 5.9.4 (With Mono 4.5)
- Windows 8.1 Pro

The project is Visual Studio compatible (.NET 4.5)

You can always send me an [email](mailto:devddstuff@gmail.com).

### TODO
- Every TODO are indicated with //TODO:

Most of them are written in Program.cs

### Issues (Code specific unrelated)
- MonoDevelop can't seem to open the CS files.
- I lack of a story (People love them!).

If you have any issues, questions, or suggestions, please open an issue ticket.

Here are some tips for issueing a good ticket:
- Recommendations are always better than orders
- You don't need to ask me "Why?" at everything I do
- Keep it polite and neutral

You can ask "Why did you [...]" but remember to keep it neutral.

### License
This project uses the MIT license, which you can read from the LICENSE file.
